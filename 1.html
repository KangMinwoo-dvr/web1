<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5">The HyperText Markup Language</a>, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be <strong>displayed in a <u>web browser</u></strong>. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
<strong>creating web page.</strong><br>
<br>he first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7]<br><br> <p>It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.</p> Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS <img src="가을.jpg">(Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
